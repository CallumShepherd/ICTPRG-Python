# Fixed indentation
greeting = input("Hello, possible pirate! What's the password? ") # added a space for readability quotation mark at the end of the string
if greeting in "Arrr!": # removed unnecessary brackets, of which one was a square bracket
    print("Go away, pirate.")
else: # changed elif statement to else as there is no condition required
    print("Greetings, hater of pirates!")
